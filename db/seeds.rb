# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#AdminSettings.create(:form_open => true,

#					 :password_hash => "PLACEHOLDER",
#					 :last_updated => DateTime.new(2001,2,3,4,5,6),
#					 :email => "anthonyfzhou@berkeley.edu",
